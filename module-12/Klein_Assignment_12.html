						<p>Drawing is a very soothing (although sometimes frustrating) pastime.
						I get to admire every part of the subject as I take important attention
						to detail. I love to see the picture in all its stages from a sketch to a polished version.
						The greatest part of drawing is that there is always something to improve and the piece is never
						truly finished.</p>

						<h3>Photography</h3>

						<hr>
						<p>I love photography almost as much as I love drawing.
							Photography is like painting a picture with a lens
							except now I am capturing all the natural colors and patterns
							as how they really are as opposed to what I perceive. Photography
							also allows me to capture great memories and make some awesome videos.
							Photos also are great complements to projects (like websites).</p>

						<h3>Adventure</h3>

						</figure>
						<hr>
						<p>Even more than drawing or photography, I love to travel and
							spend time with my family. Traveling allows me to be exposed to
							new experiences; seeing animals and plants I haven’t before,
							meeting people from all walks of life, and tasting different
							foods and spices.</p>

						<hr>
						<p>Growing up, I have always worked in the family business which was
							a restaurant called Uncle Ed’s BBQ & Catering until 2012.
							Although my parents retired out of in-house catering, we are
							still <a href="http://www.uncle-eds-bbq.com/">vendors</a> during the summer at the Racine, Kenosha, and
							Walworth County fairs in Wisconsin.</p>

						<hr>
						<p>Since we still own the Uncle Ed's BBQ and Catering building
							which resides on Powers Lake, we <a href="http://www.uncle-eds-bbq.com/">rent</a>
							piers and watercrafts
							such as pontoons & tubes, wave runners, pedalboards, and kayaks.
							I give our guests tours on the lake and show them how to operate
							the machinery. I also talk them through our liability forms.</p>

						<p>When I am not working with my parents, I am working at Target.
							I work in the Consumables department. I love working with food
							and exchanging recipes with customers. I also get exposed to new
							food products which is always exciting.</p>
