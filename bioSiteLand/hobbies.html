					<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		       <p>
		          Brandon has various hobbies: playing instruments (guitar player for
		          over 10 years and has dabbled in violin, cello, and bass), video
		          gaming, flying drones, 3D printing and modeling, and practicing
		          LiDAR/photogrammetry. Out of these hobbies, flying drones are
		          Moffitt’s favorite,
		       </p>
		       <blockquote>
		          “The adrenaline rush you get doing acrobatic
		          tricks, pulling several G’s on the frame of the aircraft is unbeatable.”

					<h2>His Favorite</h2>
	        <p>
	          Brandon thanks his father, a private pilot for 32 years, for
	          introducing him and being his mentor for learning FAA restrictions,
	          aviation laws, and everything else to do with the aviation world.
	          Brandon’s father helped him study and prepare for the exams required
	          to fly drones commercially (no license is required to fly as a
	          hobbyist for a small drone user). As a result of their efforts,
	          Brandon has been a proud holder of his Title 14 CFR Part 107:
	          sUAS license since November of 2022.
	          <br>
	          Over his six years of flying drones, Brandon has flown several.
	          The drones within his fleet currently are the DJI FPV and the
	          DJI Mini 2.

					<h2>Drones</h2>
	        <h3>DJI FPV</h3>
	        <p>
	          The DJI FPV enhances the pilot’s immersion with the aircraft by
	          implementing stable video (120 fps max frame rate) transmission
	          into their multi-antenna DJI FPV Goggles. The goggles are so
	          immersive that Brandon exclaims that, “Brandon “I even have to sit
	          down while I fly them so I don’t fall over trying to compensate so I
	          know which direction the drone is facing.” The antennas coordinate
	          communication between the air unit, remote controller, and goggles.
	          The DJI FPV camera is also a 150° ultra-wide-angle lens for an
	          expansive field-of-view. The camera also records at 4k/60fps.
	          In addition, and according to the
						<a target="_blank" href="https://www.dji.com/fpv">DJI Website</a>,
						the system can operate in three different modes:
	          Standard, Racing, and LED.

						“LED mode increases the color saturation on LED lights and

					 <h3>DJI Mini 2</h3>
					 <p>
						 The DJI Mini 2 is an even smaller drone compared to that of the
						 DJI FPV. Unlike the FPV, the Mini 2 does not have the DJI Goggles
						 but instead an app that connects to your phone that transmits with
						 the drone.
