					<h2>Profile</h2>
	        <p>
	          The nineteen-year-old, Brandon Moffitt, could be described
	          by others as someone who is persistent, informative, and
	          approachable. He would go on to describe himself as also smart,
	          determined, and technical. Brandon’s and others’ observations of
	          his own characteristics more than reflect the values that he lives by,
	        </p>
	        <blockquote>
	          ""[My life so far is] that of a pretty standard one: do what
	            you are supposed to do, work hard, and good things come… Work
	            for what you want. Don’t let others determine what you are
	            capable of. What seems impossible, is possible from another
	            perspective.” - Brandon Moffitt
	        </blockquote>

					<h2>Family</h2>
	        <p>
	          Brandon gained these values throughout his life which started
	          in Madison, WI, where he was born. Shortly after his birth, Brandon
	          and his family moved to Joliet, Il and finally to St. Charles, Il
	          where Brandon resides part time with his two sisters, Megan Moffitt
	          (13) and Emma Moffitt (20); his father, Greg Moffitt (49); his mother,
	          Tara Moffitt (43); and his three dogs: Cooper, Rocky, and Smokey.
	          The other part of his time is spent living closer to University of
	          Wisconsin – Parkside where he is currently pursuing a Bachelor’s
	          Degree in Computer Science. Even though he is away from home, Brandon
	          and his family still maintain a tight relationship,
	        </p>
	        <blockquote>
	          “We are all very close, though we have the times where we butt
	          heads. Small stuff.” - Brandon Moffitt

					<h2>Goals</h2>
	        <p>
	          Brandon also has been diagnosed with ADHD since childhood, finding
	          it difficult to conduct redundant tasks. As such, Brandon’s career
	          goal is to avoid an office. He would prefer to work remotely where
	          he can move around. Brandon’s greatest dream is to improve his
	          business, one of his <a id="inLink" href="Hobbies.html">hobbies</a>
	          that he is currently working to make it into a career, enough to
	          support him and his future family.
